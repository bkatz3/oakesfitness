# How to Fix Lower Back Pain From Sitting All Day

*By The Oakes Fitness Team*

Stretching your lower back after eight hours at a desk feels good for about twenty minutes. Then the pain comes back, because stretching doesn't fix lower back pain from sitting all day. The real cause isn't tightness alone. It's weakness. Prolonged sitting shuts off the glutes, tightens the hip flexors, and shifts load onto spinal structures that aren't designed to handle it. After 50, age-related muscle loss makes that pattern harder to reverse without targeted exercise.

## Why Does Sitting All Day Cause Lower Back Pain?

The two main culprits are hip flexor shortening and glute inhibition, and they work together to stress the lumbar spine.

When you sit for extended periods, the hip flexors (primarily the iliopsoas) stay in a shortened position. Over time, they pull the pelvis into anterior tilt, which exaggerates the lumbar curve and compresses the lower vertebrae. At the same time, the glutes become inhibited through reciprocal inhibition: when the hip flexors are constantly contracted, the opposing muscles become neurologically suppressed. The back absorbs load it shouldn't.

Intervertebral discs don't have a direct blood supply. They receive nutrients through the compression and decompression that happens when you move. Long stretches of stillness reduce disc hydration and decrease the cushioning the discs provide.

After 50, this compounds quickly. [Sarcopenia reduces the baseline strength of the muscles that stabilize the lumbar spine](https://oakesfitness.com/blog/2026-02-23-how-to-build-muscle-after-50-without-wrecking-your-joints): the glutes, hamstrings, and deep core. Someone in their 50s or 60s who has been desk-bound for most of their career may have meaningful deficits in exactly the muscles needed to protect the lower back before sitting adds anything to the equation.

## What Exercises Fix Lower Back Pain From Sitting?

The most effective approach is strengthening the posterior chain and deep core, not stretching in isolation. A 2017 systematic review in the *Annals of Internal Medicine* ([Chou et al., PMID 28192793](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28192793/)) found evidence supporting exercise therapy for chronic low back pain, with pain benefits ranging from small to moderate across multiple included trials.

Four exercises address the specific pattern created by prolonged sitting:

| Exercise | Target | Starting Point |
|---|---|---|
| Glute bridge | Glutes, posterior chain | 3x12, bodyweight |
| Hip hinge (Romanian deadlift) | Hamstrings, glutes, lumbar stabilizers | 3x8-10, light weight |
| Dead bug | Deep core (transverse abdominis) | 3x6 per side |
| Kneeling hip flexor stretch | Iliopsoas | 60 seconds per side |

The glute bridge is the best starting point. It directly activates the glutes without loading the lumbar spine, and most people with desk-related back pain notice a difference within a week or two of consistent practice. The dead bug trains the transverse abdominis, the deep core layer that acts as a natural brace for the lumbar spine.

Do all four, three times per week. The stretch is effective when paired with the strengthening, not as a replacement for it.

Walking helps too. A 10-minute walk every 90 minutes restores disc hydration and prevents the glutes from shutting down completely.

## How Long Until Lower Back Pain From Sitting Goes Away?

Most adults over 50 with desk-related back pain see noticeable improvement within 4-6 weeks of consistent strengthening. Consistent means three sessions per week, not once when you remember it.

Hormonal factors can extend the timeline. Post-menopausal estrogen decline affects connective tissue quality and increases inflammatory sensitivity. Low testosterone in men over 50 reduces the rate of muscle repair. Neither of these stops the exercises from working, but both may slow the initial response.

If back pain has persisted for more than six months and targeted exercise hasn't helped, the pattern may be more specific than desk work alone. Disc herniation, SI joint dysfunction, and spinal stenosis each need different approaches, and they can't be reliably distinguished without an in-person assessment. A [free consultation](https://oakesfitness.com/contact.html) is the right move at that point.

At Oakes Fitness, lower back pain is one of the most common issues new clients over 50 bring in on day one. We assess the movement pattern, identify what's weak or restricted, and build a program around correcting it.

## Key Takeaways

- Desk-related lower back pain is caused primarily by weak glutes and deep core muscles, not tightness alone: prolonged sitting inhibits the glutes through reciprocal inhibition and shifts load onto the lumbar spine.
- Adults over 50 are more vulnerable because sarcopenia reduces the stabilizing strength around the lumbar spine before desk work adds to the deficit.
- Strengthening exercises (glute bridge, hip hinge, dead bug) combined with hip flexor stretching outperform stretching alone for chronic desk-related back pain, according to multiple systematic reviews.
- A structured strengthening program done three times per week typically produces noticeable improvement within 4-6 weeks for desk-related back pain.
- If lower back pain persists beyond six months despite consistent exercise, an in-person movement assessment is the appropriate next step to rule out disc issues, SI joint dysfunction, or spinal stenosis.
