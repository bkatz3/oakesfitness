                <p>Five years ago, Mike Oakes opened the doors to Oakes Fitness with a clear mission: help people get stronger, move better, and live healthier lives. What started as a single studio has grown into two locations, a team of dedicated coaches, and a community of clients we're genuinely proud to work with every day.</p>
                <p>We don't take that lightly.</p>
                <h2>What Five Years Looks Like</h2>
                <p>In five years, we've watched clients lose weight they'd been trying to lose for decades. We've seen people come in post-surgery, nervous and unsure, and leave months later stronger than they've ever been. We've trained teenagers who went on to compete at the college level. We've worked with people in their 70s who wanted to stay independent and active — and did.</p>
                <p>Every one of those stories is what this is about. Not the equipment, not the square footage. The people.</p>
                <h2>Thank You</h2>
                <p>To every client who has trusted us with their health — thank you. You didn't have to choose Oakes Fitness. You did, and you kept showing up. That means everything.</p>
                <p>To the trainers who have been part of this team — your expertise, your care, and your commitment to doing this the right way is what sets us apart.</p>
                <p>And to the Westford and Concord communities who have supported us from day one — we're glad to be here, and we're not going anywhere.</p>
                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                <p>Five years in, we're more motivated than ever. The Westford expansion we completed earlier this year is just one example of our commitment to continuing to invest in the experience we provide. We have new programs, new ideas, and a lot of training left to do.</p>
                <p>Here's to the next five. Thank you for being part of it.</p>
