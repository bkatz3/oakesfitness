                        <p>"I have been a client of Mike Oakes' for over 10 years. During that time, my fitness journey and goals have changed. When I first started with Mike, I was trying to maintain a 40 pound weight loss, but over the years it has morphed into feeling strong, independent, and empowered in my body. No longer was my goal to see a certain number on the scale, but rather I wanted to see a change in my muscle tone, I wanted functional strength, and above all I wanted to avoid injury. Having been a runner for 20+ years, there was a lot of wear and tear on certain muscle groups and weakness in others as those muscles tried to compensate. Mike understood how important running was for me mentally, and we were able to work together to strengthen certain weak areas and gain mobility in order to maintain my ability to run pain and injury free.</p>

                        <p>Mike's training sessions are personal and tailored to your unique goals - even when those goals change. It's the best feeling in the world - both mentally and physically - to show up to a workout not knowing what to expect, sweating and working hard, and then realizing that was EXACTLY what you needed that day. I'm not sure what tomorrow will bring in my fitness journey, but I am confident that with Mike at my side I will continue to see great progress. Fitness is a life-long journey and it should evolve with you. Mike understands that and takes great pride in seeing his clients succeed."</p>
